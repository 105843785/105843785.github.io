        I like working with computers. It's my hobby and my profession. I love the Internet and the way it works, and I am comfortable working on web applications, frontend and backend. I've worked on smartphone apps, both native and hybrid, and I have experience with Linux system administration.

        My role models include old-school programmers and <a href="https://stallman.org/articles/on-hacking.html">hackers</a> who never make it to the mainstream news, but are responsible for most of the software that most people use on an everyday basis. I promote, support and use free and open source software to the extent possible.

        I maintain a little blog at <a href="https://www.nagekar.com">nagekar.com</a> where I write about my recent interests and other activities. I post my software projects on <a href="https://github.com/abhn/">Github</a> as well. My email address can be found at the <span class="extra-link"><a href="#extra">bottom</a></span> of this page.
